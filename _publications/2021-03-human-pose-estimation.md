This is the first academic paper that uses the AI deck. The Crazyflie uses the HIMAX camera attached to the GAP8 chip to estimate its relative pose and position to a person nearby, and keeps that pose
constant even if the person moves around or other people or objects enter its field of vision. Some small part of the software can be found in Jerome Guzzis Github repo; the full code seems not to be 
published (yet).
