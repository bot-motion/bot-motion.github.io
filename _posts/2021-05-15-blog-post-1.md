Today I played around with the [barometric pressure sensor BMP388](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/pressure-sensors/bmp388/) that is part
of the IMU combo BMI088/BMP388 that's onboard the CF2.1.

To get a feel for the precision and latency of raw data, I added a log group to the driver `sensors_bmi088_bmp388.c`. In the original init code for the sensor, the update 
is very fast, because the smoothing IIR filter within the sensor is set to a low efficacy.

Changing the setting to the following

    /* Select the output data rate and oversampling settings for pressure and temperature */
    bmp388Dev.settings.odr_filter.press_os = BMP3_OVERSAMPLING_8X;
    bmp388Dev.settings.odr_filter.temp_os = BMP3_NO_OVERSAMPLING;
    bmp388Dev.settings.odr_filter.odr = BMP3_ODR_50_HZ;
    bmp388Dev.settings.odr_filter.iir_filter = BMP3_IIR_FILTER_COEFF_31;

yields a much smoother, but also much slower update:
